Who we are 
▪At home.made, we believe your build should be as unique as you are. We combine the strength and precision of light steel frame construction with fully customizable designs — so every home we build is truly one of a kind.
▪Specialising in small space pod units, we create for you a unique solution to meet your needs.
▪Our approach strips away the inefficiencies of traditional construction. Light steel framing means faster build times, less waste, and a structure that stands the test of time. And because every component is precision-engineered, your home fits together perfectly.
What we create 
▪Light steel frame modular units
▪Factory built
▪Configured to brief : bed, bath, kitchen, living, deck
▪Choice of finishes and designs
Why 
▪Time. Units are factory built concurrent with onsite groundworks. This significantly reduces construction time, minimizes weather exposure
▪Unique foundation design. allows for an adaptable build on slopes, uneven territory, sensitive terrain. Factory built units are transported to site, assembled, finished and handed over.
▪Green. Sustainabilitty.
▪Cost efficient. Finishes can be scaled up or down
▪Future proof. Grow, relocate, re-configure.

Business Summary 
This presentation outlines the business model and value proposition for home.made, a construction company specializing in modular, light steel frame (LSF) housing.

Core Identity
●Methodology: Combines precision-engineered light steel frame construction with fully customizable modular designs.
●Specialization: Small-space "pod units" designed for efficiency and uniqueness.
●Advantage: Replaces traditional construction inefficiencies with faster build times, reduced waste, and high structural durability.
Product Features
●Modular Units: Factory-built pods configured to specific briefs (Bedroom, Bathroom, Kitchen, Living, and Deck).
●Technical Specs: Maximum unit width of 3.4m.
●Customization: Clients select layouts, interior finishes, and high-end add-ons (fireplaces, pizza ovens, hot tubs).
Strategic Benefits
●Efficiency: Factory production occurs concurrently with site groundworks, significantly shortening the project timeline.
●Adaptability: A unique foundation design allows for building on slopes, uneven territory, or environmentally sensitive terrain.
●Sustainability: Focused on "green" building practices and reduced material waste.
●Flexibility: Units are "future-proof," meaning they can be relocated, reconfigured, or expanded as needs change.
The "How it Works" Process
1.Design: Selection of units and finishes from a "Design Menu."
2.Engineer: Precision engineering of all components.
3.Build: Simultaneous factory production and on-site preparation.
4.Handover: Transport, assembly, and final finishing on-site.
About home.made 
At home.made, we don't just build houses; we engineer high-performance living spaces. Based on a philosophy of efficiency and adaptability, our modular approach utilizes Light Steel Frame (LSF) technology to deliver precision-crafted 'pod units' that bridge the gap between architectural luxury and industrial speed.
Why choose home.made?
●Precision Engineering: Every unit is factory-built to a maximum width of 3.4m, ensuring structural integrity and easy transport.
●Simultaneous Production: By building your home in our factory while groundworks are completed on-site, we deliver your space in a fraction of the time.
●Terrain Versatility: Our unique foundation designs mean we can build where others can't—on slopes, uneven ground, and eco-sensitive sites.
●Sustainable & Future-Proof: We minimize material waste and design our units to be relocatable or expandable, ensuring your home evolves with your lifestyle.
From the first selection on our Design Menu to the final on-site handover, home.made provides a seamless, transparent, and eco-conscious path to modern living.
